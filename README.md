# Java Docs Search Engine

This is a system for retrieving java 8 document.

## How to Use

1. To utilize this system, you should have 4 JavaDocs files prepared: namely `JAVA_DOC.json`, `Java_Doc_Function_Similarity.json`, `Java_Doc_Similarity.csv`, and `Java_Doc_Weights.csv`. Then, ensure these files are located under the [java_doc](./java_doc) path.

2. Create a virtual environment for Python. (e.g. venv)

3. Afterward, you only need to execute the following command for installation and use.

```bash
pip install jdoc
```
